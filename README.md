# JATE (A PWA text editor)

## Description

Understanding PWAs is an important part of web development, and a big part of that is allowing data to persist with the use of caching, indexedDBs, and even in some cases the ability to precache images/webpages/etc for better user experience. In this app, we've built a text editor using Webpacks that cache the users text inputs, the JATE logo, and even the option to download this as an app to your computer to use in offline circumstances.
